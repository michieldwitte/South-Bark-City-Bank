 * General interface for running through a session.

 * Here is boilerplate code:
<code><pre>
 	SRPRunner		runner = ...
	while ( runner.next() )
	{
		if ( runner.hasOutput() )
		{
			BigInteger		output = runner.getOutput();
 			// TODO: send output to corresponding client/server
		}

		if ( runner.needsInput() )
		{
 			// TODO: get BigInteger from corresponding client/server
 			BigInteger		i = ... // read from client/server
			runner.setInput(i);
		}
	}

 	// at this point, runner.success() can be called to determine if authentication was successful.
</pre></code>
